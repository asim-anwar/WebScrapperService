# Important Note:
The API does not work all the time as I could not avoid antibots. So if the API does not work at first, please keep trying until it works.

I have saved some successful responses in files and uploaded in the repository. Feel free to look into them. The files start with the name response.

Thank you for assigning the task. I had fun doing it :D
